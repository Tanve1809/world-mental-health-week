         Federation for Mental Health, a global mental health organization with members and contacts 
         in more than 150 countries.Green is the color of mental health representing hope, strength, 
         support, and encouragement for sufferers. This day, each October, thousands of supporters come to celebrate 
         this annual awareness program to bring attention to mental illness and its major effects on peoples' lives worldwide.

   <h2>Why is World Mental Health Week Important??</h2>

   <p>World Mental Health Day 2020 is the most important one yet. The months of lockdown and loss have
        had a huge impact on us all, and prioritising mental health has never been more important than it is now.
        <br>
        <br>
   That's why this year we want to bring everyone together to mark the day by each doing one thing for better mental health.
    <br>
    <br>
    Making positive change can seem so hard, especially during uncertain times. And sometimes, it can be hard 
    to know where to start. Take the opportunity this World Mental Health Day to find out more about how you can start with one thing.</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 We all need to take care of our mental health and wellbeing whether we have a mental health problem or not.

Mental wellbeing describes how you are feeling and how well you can cope with day-to-day life.
 It can change from moment to moment, day to day, month to month or year to year.
